# Toronto-Housing

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and an RMarkdown file used to analysis Toronto homeless shelter system throughout the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021. The data was pulled from Open Toronto’s Toronto Shelter System Flow dataset. The purpose of this report was to discover how Covid-19 and Toronto’s pandemic measure affected Toronto’s homeless population. 

The final report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ChristinaChanYing/Toronto-Shelter-System/blob/main/outputs/paper/Toronto-Shelter-System-Flow.pdf).
